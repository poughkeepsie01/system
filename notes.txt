pwede ba mag tap out kahit lalabas lang?

ye since required pa rin mag tap out sa front desk -should just choose an option of check in or check out

and iba dadaanan sa pag exit 

automatic maglolock yung door after mag tap in sa pinto

to target the customer for in out insertion, use the id number of card

mas maganda at madali pag fix time 

can say that the card is a perks when choosing the hotel

pwede 2 or more rooms sa isang account?
2 paths:
1st pwede kasi gusto nya naman yun
2nd di pwede unless may 2nd person na bibigyan ng acc and card

WHEN LOGGED OUT THE USER CANNOT DO TRANSACTION

pwede ba multiple account pero iisang tao??


what if di bumalik pero nagbayad na 
in first 12 hours contact lang si user either sumagot or hindi 
if wala pa rin,  sa 2nd 12 hours contact ulit si user if di sumagot, an employee will inspect the room
